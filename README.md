# AlongthePike fork of WABA Bike Infrastructure Map Project

## Development

This is a fork of the original WABA Bike Map project from DCFemTech where I am continuing to work on the infrastructure code which 
fetches, maps and filters the raw GIS files from each jurisdiction to produce consistent, more useful GeoJSON.

Once you've installed Node, to run this project:

1. Clone the repo locally: `git clone https://github.com/alongthepike/hackforgood-waba-map.git` or `git clone git@github.com:alongthepike/hackforgood-waba-map.git` depending on your git setup
2. Change into the directory: `cd hackforgood-waba-map`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Fetch and process the jurisdictional GIS files: `npm run fetch`
